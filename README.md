# 8week-SQL-R-challenge
This is inspired by Danny Ma's 8weekSQLchallenge. There are 8 real life case studies/projects that are often seen at work.

I have tried to solve the case studies using my understanding of the problem andprogramming languages.

Although it was supposed to be done only in SQL, I have also solved the problems in R (as evident by the repository name)

This is still a work in progress as I try to solve the case studies one at a time.

It was my first time playing with R in an actual project. I had loads of fun with it. Trying to do the same thing in SQL first definitely helped a lot.

Do check out the case studies to find out more.
